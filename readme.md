Boilerplate for preact + hooks + custom-elements projects using a create-react-app typescript template overridden with customize-cra.

- [x] Apply minimal overrides to allow the use of preact using customize-cra
- [ ] Add CSS modules, Jest, Storybook examples
- [ ] Allow easy scaffolding of components via a cli
- [ ] Components published to npm can be imported as ES modules or declared as custom elements in a range of FE scenarios
